You can open the model in gazebo by using the world file inside this folder.

However, YOU MUST HAVE YOUR GAZEBO MODEL PATH POINTING TO THE FOLDER ABOVE THIS FOLDER. i.e.

Gazebo model path: ~/catkin_ws/src/package/FOLDER_OF_IMPORTANCE

if the world is located here:  ~/catkin_ws/src/package/FOLDER_OF_IMPORTANCE/Gazebo_REEL/REEL.world
