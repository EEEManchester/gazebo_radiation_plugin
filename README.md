# Gazebosim Radiation Sensor/Sources Plugin

**Needs proof reading and more detail adding to the example**

The repository contains code to adding custom radiation sensors and sources into gazebo. 

These sensors and sources provide plugin libraries defines in the radiation_sensor/source.xml files which can be included like any other sensor into an sdf using the "plugin" tags inside the "sensor" tags.

Once loaded the sensors and sources will discover each other within gazebo and calculate the expected measurements at the sensor based on intensity dropoff (1/r^2), attenuation through objects and collomation of the sensor, based on either a sensitivity function or angular window. 

The values calculated by the sensor along with the sensor pose are then published on both gazebo topics and to rostopics,with the name taking the form of: "/radiation_sensor_plugin/sensor_X" where X is the name given to the sensor.

Info about the sources are also published on: "/radiation_sensor_plugin/source_Y/\*type\*", but this is just for debugging/sanity checking and is not used by the sensor at all.

#### Recent Additions

* Launch files added to allow for mapping of an environement using a husky with a radiation sensor using the radiation_mapping.launch file. (requires radiation_layer)
* More environments added, including some (reactor room and REEl) made from CAD files
* blender_script added to export .fbx cad files to daes
* Scripts and services added to allow the importing of worlds from the gazebosim_world_builder and to generate worlds from a folder of dae files i.e. for use with the blender script.
* Services added to allow for automated world degrading and random selection of models to be degraded.

## Important note!!!

This repository borrows a script called custom sensor preloader from: https://github.com/peci1/gazebo_custom_sensor_preloader.

I should just make this depend on that package but I get compile issues when I try to do this.(Most likely user error).   

**I am not trying to take credit for peci1's god like coding of the preloader!**

## Install Requirements

To use the radiaiton sources and sensors gazebosim must be of a version  7.4.* or higher. The easiest way to update this for a user running ros kinetic is to run:

**Note you may need sudo to run these commands so copy and paste one at a time and act accordingly to the responce!**

```
apt remove ros-kinetic-gazebo* gazebo* libgazebo*
```
 
Once removed we can then add the osrf gazebo repositories following these instructions: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu 
or the tldr is to run:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list' 

cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list   
```

Which should return: ```deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable bionic main```

And then run: 

```
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -

apt update

apt install ros-kinetic-gazebo* gazebo* libgazebo*

gazebo --version
```
If everything has gone correctly you should see a version number of 7.16.0 or higher.

Once updated we should be able to catkin_make the repository without any issues.

## Code

This repository contains several bits of code:

#### Plugins

##### CustomSensorPreloader.cpp/h 
for loading custom sensors into gazebo 
##### RadiationSensor.cpp/h
creates a gazebo radiation sensor 
##### RadiationSource.cpp/h
creates a gazebo radiation source 
##### RadiationSensorPlugin.cpp/h
creates a plugin interface between ros and gazebo for the sensors
##### RadiationSourcePlugin.cpp/h 
creates a plugin interface between ros and gazebo for the sources

#### Scripts

##### gazebo.in
runs gazebo with the customsensorpreloader script

When using the custom sensors with gazebo you need to use rosrun gazebo_radiation_plugin gazebo(/gzserver)
##### gzserver.in
runs gzserver with the customsensor script
##### generate_radiation_sources.py
creates example radiation sources from rosparameters (requires the sources.yaml file to be loaded into the rosparam server)
##### load_radiation_sources.py
Adds each of the example sources into gazebo from the folder specified sources_folder.

##### mass_yaml_loader.py
Used to load all yaml files in a folder onto the rosparam server. 
This is used to load all of the yaml files used by the model_evolver service onto the server.

#### Non-ROS

##### generate_model_list.py

Python script used ot generate the model lists when a world has been made using a CAD file rather than the world builder. 
As the CAD files are never passed through the convert_world_builder_model service these files are not generated.

This shoudl be combined into the generate_world_from_models services in the future. 

##### blender_script/export_to_dae.py

Shold be run through blender.

It allows for CAD models to be exported to a folder where each element is its own .dae file


#### Services

**Note for many of these services to work, the template folder structure found in the custom_models folder should be adhered to!**

Below are all of the services, their required input arguments and what they do.

##### convert_world_builder_model.py

Imports a model made using the gazebosim_world_builder (or any other gazebo .world file) into a folder specified. This will create duplicate models for each item in the model which share a common model to allow for deformation. 
If a noise file is specied some initial deformation is applied to each model as to make them all unique. 

See media/world_builder_to_model_evolver for reference.

* world_builder_file: The location of the world to be imported
* gazebo_model_path: Where to create the new model. This should be in one of the gazebo_model_paths, which can be specified in the package.xml export tags.
* noise_file: the location of the noise file. This allows random deformations to be applied to each of the models to make them unique. An example file is found in custom_models/template/yamls/models_with_noise_example.yaml. This causes all of the items which use the model called barrel.dae to be deformed slightly physically and in colour.
  
This service also produced the all/bendable/rustable_models.txt files which is placed into the models folder. These files contain lists of all of the which have been found to be useable for:

adding radiation: all_models.txt
be bendable: bendable_models.txt
be rustable: rustable_models.txt

##### generate_random_environment_effects.py

This service will randomly select models to add radiation sources to based on the all/bendable/rustable_models.txt files in the models folder. If models exist in these files you do not want considering e.g. walls. Just delete them from the files

Once called this service will produce a file called subset.yaml in the yaml folder of the world. which contains the details of which models have been selected for radiation/bending/rusting and how much each will be changed at each evolution. These can be manually altered if required.

* folder: The folder of the custom world  e.g. path/to/custom_models/exampe_world/
* number_of_radiation_sources: Desired number of radiation sources to be added
* number_of_rusting_models: Desired number of rusting models to be altered
* number_of_bending_models: Desire number of expanding models to be altered
* max_bend_factor: The maximum amount of bend allowed at each evolution as a decimal. i.e. 1% would be 0.01
* max_rust_factor: The maximum amount of rust to be added at each evolution as a decimal.

##### generate_world_from_models.py

If an enviroment is created using the blender script. The template folder in the custom_models folder should be copied and renamed. Then the produced .dae files shoudl be put in the models folder within the new folder. i.e. custom_models/*NEW_MODEL_NAME*/models/ . 

Once copied this service can be invoked to produce a world file based on all of the models within the folder.  

* folder: The folder to be used for the new custom world e.g. path/to/custom_models/example_world/
* model_filename The name of the output world. e.g. new_model.world

##### generate_yamls_for_world.py

This service will generate all of the yaml files used by the model_evolver service based on the subset.yaml file.

Once called this service will produce a number of yaml files placed into the yaml folder of the environment. These will need to be loaded onto the rosparam server for use with the model_evolver service. This can be done manually or by using the mass_yaml_loader script.

* folder: the location of the custom_world folder. e.g. path/to/custom_models/example_world/
* world_filename: the filename of the world file no path required. 
* model_subset_filename: the location of the subset file: e.g. yamls/subset.yaml
* default_bend: the default value used if one is not specified int he subset.yaml file. 
* default_rust: the default value used if one is not specified int he subset.yaml file.
* default_radiation: the default value used if one is not specified int he subset.yaml file.

##### model_evolver.py

Used to evolve the environment based on the yaml files loaded on the rosparam server.

##### model_mover.py
For testing. This service simply rotates a model called sensor in a circle. See media/gazebo_radiation_sensor_and_sources for details 

### Additional Settings

The radiation sensor has some additional settings which can be set on the param server these are type,range,collimated,mu,sigma and attenuation_factors.

For each sensor type and range should be loaded using /SENSOR_NAME/type and /SENSOR_NAME/range where SENSOR_NAME is the sensor name e.g. sensor_0. These parameters allow you to set maximum sensing ranges and radiation types the sensor is detecting . e.g. Alpha, Beta, Gamma; if the sensor is collimated and if it is collimated define the mu and sigma of the (gaussian)sensitivity function. If these are set the sensor will disregard anything too far away or of the wrong radiation type and reduce the measured radiation in accordance with the angle of incidency using the sensitivity function. 

Attenuation_factors is set using a yaml file and is explained in the running the example section.

### Running the example


**EXAMPLE NEEDS UPDATING WITH ALL NEW FEATURES!!!!**

The first thing which needs to be done is load some parameters into the rosparam server which relate to the radiation sources being used. Basic sources can be described in the format shown in configs/sources.yaml requiring x,y,z,type and value,noise and units. Use:
 ```
roscore
 ```
Then load the sources yaml file located in the configs folder by cd'ing into the folder and running
 ```
rosparam load sources.yaml
```
to load these onto the rosparam server.

We can then use:
```
rosrun gazebo_radiation_plugins generate_radiation_sources.py
```
 to create sources with the provided parameters which will be written into the sources folder. 

Optionally we can load attenuation values into the parameter server too using the configs/attenuation.yaml file.
This allows for objects to have attenuation factors different from 0 or 1(free space and blockages). 
Use: 
 ```
rosparam load attentuation.yaml
```

to load these parameters. 

Next we will bring up gazebo with the custom sensor preloader. This is done by calling 

```
rosrun gazebo_radiation_plugins gazebo --verbose      <- verbose not required just useful
```

Once running we can load our example sources using:

```
rosrun gazebo_radiation_plugins load_radiation_sources.py
```

And then finally we can load an example sensor using:
```
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file src/gazebo_radiation_plugins/templates/radiation_sensor.sdf  -sdf -x 0 -y 0 -z 0.1 -model sensor
```
(for real use this sensor would be attached to a robot).

a script to move the example sensor is included.
```
rosrun gazebo_radiation_plugins model_mover.py
```

Now you should be able to see the rostopic showing up for the sensor and how the value changes as you move it around. NB: if collomation is being use then the green square represents the front of the sensor and thus the sensor will need rotating around to face the sources.
